### More convenient testing of Gradle plugins

Gradle 2.6 introduced the “[Gradle TestKit](userguide/test_kit.html)” which made it easier to thoroughly test Gradle plugins.
The TestKit has improved and matured with subsequent Gradle releases.

Starting with Gradle 2.13, less manual build configuration is required in order to make your plugin implementation available to test builds.
The [Java Gradle Plugin Development Plugin](userguide/javaGradle_plugin.html) now integrates with the TestKit by making the plugin under test's implementation classpath discoverable at test time.

See the [TestKit chapter in the Gradle User Guide](userguide/test_kit.html#sub:test-kit-automatic-classpath-injection) for more about this new feature.

### Customizing the HTML reports of Checkstyle and FindBugs

The HTML reports generated by the Checkstyle and FindBugs plugins can now be customized with local XSLT stylesheets.
See the documentation for the [Checkstyle](userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html) and [FindBugs](userguide/findbugs_plugin.html)
plugins for more details. Note that sample stylesheets for both plugins are available at:

- Checkstyle: [https://github.com/checkstyle/contribution/tree/master/xsl](https://github.com/checkstyle/contribution/tree/master/xsl)
- Findbugs: [https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/tree/master/findbugs/src/xsl](https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/tree/master/findbugs/src/xsl)

### Support for Groovydoc's noTimestamp and noVersionStamp flags

Groovy 2.4.6 adds two new flags to its Groovydoc command.
Using these flags produce Groovydoc HTML pages without timestamp or Groovy version stamp information embedded within them.
This means that it is harder to determine when or which version of Groovy produced the pages but means the pages remain totally unchanged across builds unless the actual content changes.

Two properties are added and can be used as follows.

    groovydoc {
        noTimestamp = true
        noVersionStamp = true
    }

The flags are ignored for versions of Groovy prior to 2.4.6.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Deleting no longer follows symlinks.

The Delete task will no longer follow symlinks by default and project.delete() will not follow symlinks at all. Previous versions of Gradle would follow-symlinks during deletions. If you need the Delete
task to follow symlinks set `followSymlinks = true`. If you need `project.delete()` to follow symlinks, replace it with `ant.delete()`. This was done to prevent issues where Gradle would attempt to delete files
outside of Gradle's build directory (e.g. NPM installed in a user-writeable location.).

### Task input properties names now follow the JavaBean specification

Task input properties now follow the JavaBean specification and thus are on par with Groovy. This means that:

- Input properties are now addressed with coherent names in validation error messages, the DSL and through `task.getInputs().getProperties()`.
- Input properties with getters like `getCFlags()` are now addressable through `task.getInputs().getProperties()` via `CFlags` instead of the erroneous `cFlags`.
- Input properties with getters like `getURL()` are now addressable through `task.getInputs().getProperties()` via `URL` instead of the erroneous `uRL`.
